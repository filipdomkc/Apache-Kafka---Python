# Multiple Producers and Multiple Consumers, same Topic

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows you to publish and subscribe to streams of records, store those records in a fault-tolerant manner, and process them. In Kafka, you can have multiple producers and consumers communicating through topics.
Let's assume you have Kafka up and running on your local machine, and you have a topic named "my-topic" that you want to work with.
To demonstrate multiple producers and consumers working with the same Kafka topic from the terminal:

## Create a Kafka Topic

You can create a Kafka topic using the following command:

    bin\windows\kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

This command creates a topic named "my-topic" with a single partition and no replication. You can adjust the number of partitions and replication as needed.

## Start Multiple Producers

Open multiple terminal windows to simulate multiple producers, and run the following command in each window to start a producer:

    bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.sh --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

This command starts a Kafka producer that allows you to enter messages that will be sent to the "my-topic" topic. You can have as many producer instances as you like.

## Start Multiple Consumers

Open multiple terminal windows to simulate multiple consumers, and run the following command in each window to start a consumer:

    bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092


## Sending Messages

You can now use your producer terminals to send messages to the "my-topic" topic. Just type messages and press Enter.

## Reading Messages

Consumers can read messages from the topic. By default, consumers read messages from the latest offset. However, you can use the --from-beginning flag to read messages from the beginning of the topic.

Without --from-beginning:

    bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

This consumer will read messages from the latest offset. If a message is produced after the consumer starts, it will read that message.

With --from-beginning:

    bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --from-beginning

This consumer will read messages from the beginning of the topic, even if the messages were produced before the consumer started.

Now, you can see that multiple producers can send messages to the same Kafka topic, and multiple consumers can read those messages either from the latest offset or from the beginning, depending on the --from-beginning flag. This allows for a flexible and scalable message processing system using Kafka.
