# Apache Kafka Arhitecture High-level Overview

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is designed for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It provides a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and publish-subscribe messaging system. Here's a high-level overview of its architecture:

##  Topics
Kafka messages are organized into topics, which are like channels or categories. Producers write data to topics, and consumers read from them. Topics can have multiple partitions to allow for parallel processing.

## Producers
Producers are applications that publish data to Kafka topics. They can be sending data in real-time or batch mode. Producers determine to which topic and partition they send messages.

## Brokers
Kafka clusters are composed of multiple Kafka brokers. Brokers are responsible for storing the data, handling reads and writes, and serving client requests. A Kafka cluster typically consists of multiple brokers for scalability and fault tolerance.

## Partitions
Each topic can be split into multiple partitions, which allow data parallelism and distribution. Partitions are the unit of parallelism and can be spread across multiple brokers. Messages within a partition are ordered, but there's no global ordering across partitions.

## Consumers
Consumers read data from Kafka topics. They can subscribe to one or more topics and read from multiple partitions concurrently. Kafka allows both real-time processing (e.g., streaming) and batch processing (e.g., Hadoop integration).

## Consumer Groups
Multiple consumers can form a consumer group. Each consumer within a group reads from a unique subset of partitions. Kafka ensures that each message is delivered to only one member of the group. This enables load balancing and fault tolerance.

## ZooKeeper (optional)
In older versions of Kafka, ZooKeeper was used for managing the cluster, leader election, and maintaining metadata. However, as of Kafka 2.8+, ZooKeeper is no longer a requirement, and Kafka operates in a self-contained mode.

## Replication
Kafka provides data redundancy and fault tolerance through replication. Each partition can have multiple replicas, with one leader and the rest being followers. If a broker fails, a leader is elected from the followers to maintain availability.

## Retention
Kafka allows data retention for a specified period. Once data exceeds this period, it can be deleted. This is useful for building data pipelines and handling backlogs.

Kafka's architecture is designed to be highly scalable, durable, and capable of handling massive amounts of data with low latency. It's commonly used in various use cases, including log aggregation, real-time data analysis, event sourcing, and building data pipelines for Big Data processing.

1. Start Kafka Brokers: You start the Kafka brokers using the kafka-server-start command. Each broker can run independently.

2. Create Topics: You can create topics using the kafka-topics command.

3. Producers and Consumers: You can use Kafka producers and consumers as usual to publish and consume data.

 -> The "Producer" sends data to the Kafka cluster.
 
 -> The Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers (servers).
 -> Within the cluster, there are different topics, which represent data channels or categories. Each topic can have multiple partitions for parallel processing.
 
 -> Consumers (Consumer 1, Consumer 2, ..., Consumer N) read data from specific topics and partitions within the Kafka cluster. Each consumer can subscribe to one or more topics or partitions, and multiple consumers can work together in a consumer group to
