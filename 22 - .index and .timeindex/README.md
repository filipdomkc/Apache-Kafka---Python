# .index and .timeindex

Storage structure file schema looks like this:

The ```.log ``` file is an actual segment containing records up to a specific offset. The name of the file defines the starting offset of the records in that log.

The ```.index``` file contains an index that maps a logical offset (in effect the recordâ€™s id) to the byte offset of the record within the .log file. It is used for accessing records at specified offsets in the log without having to scan the whole ```.log``` file. It helps Kafka know what part of a segment to read to find a message.

The ```.timeindex``` file is another index used for accessing records by timestamp in the log.
